                    <p class="paragraph-3 _2 _4"><strong>Choosing a chef&#x27;s knife:</strong> Your chef&#x27;s knife is your ally in the kitchen. You&#x27;ll use it every day, every time you cook, so make sure you buy one that feels comfortable in your hand: not too heavy or too light, not too long or too short, just right. If you can, go to a store that has several different kinds and brands of chef&#x27;s knives and give them all a try. But remember: you only need one solid knife.<br /><br /><strong>Your knife should be sharp!</strong> Next up, make sure your knife is sharp and honed. It should be able to cut through ingredients cleanly and easily without needing to use a lot of force. If it doesn&#x27;t, take it to a professional knife sharpener to get it fixed up. If you had your knife sharpened recently, it may just need to be honed on a honing steel to straighten out the edge.<br /><br /><strong>How to hold the knife.</strong> Good knife skills start with holding the knife properly. Pinch the blade of the knife where it meets the handle between your thumb and first finger, then wrap the rest of your fingers around the handle. (Do not lay your first finger across the top of the blade.) This position will give you the most leverage and control as you cut and dice. It might feel a little awkward at first, but if you keep practicing holding your knife this way, it will quickly start to feel natural. Watch the video above to really see how this is done.<br /><br /><strong>Use &quot;The Claw&quot; to protect your other hand.</strong> Be sure to protect your other hand as you cut: use &quot;The Claw&quot; position. Curl the fingers of your opposite hand into a &quot;claw&quot; and rest just the tips of your fingers on top of the ingredient you&#x27;re about to cut. Tuck your thumb in; your wrist should be parallel to the cutting board. As you slice, move your fingers back, still keeping this claw formation. If your knife slips as you cut, it will hit against your knuckles or fingernails, protecting you from a serious slice.<br /><br /><strong>Stabilize your cutting board.</strong> Last but not least, stabilize your cutting board by placing a rubber mat or a damp paper towel underneath. This will keep it from slipping as you cut, helping you work more quickly and safely.</p>

You&#x27;ll use it every day, every time you cook, so make sure you buy one that feels comfortable in your hand: not too heavy or too light, not too long or too short, just right. If you can, go to a store that has several different kinds and brands of chef&#x27;s knives and give them all a try. But remember: you only need one solid knife.<br /><br /><strong>Your knife should be sharp!</strong> Next up, make sure your knife is sharp and honed. It should be able to cut through ingredients cleanly and easily without needing to use a lot of force. If it doesn&#x27;t, take it to a professional knife sharpener to get it fixed up. If you had your knife sharpened recently, it may just need to be honed on a honing steel to straighten out the edge.<br /><br /><strong>How to hold the knife.</strong> Good knife skills start with holding the knife properly. Pinch the blade of the knife where it meets the handle between your thumb and first finger, then wrap the rest of your fingers around the handle. (Do not lay your first finger across the top of the blade.) This position will give you the most leverage and control as you cut and dice. It might feel a little awkward at first, but if you keep practicing holding your knife this way, it will quickly start to feel natural. Watch the video above to really see how this is done.<br /><br /><strong>Use &quot;The Claw&quot; to protect your other hand.</strong> Be sure to protect your other hand as you cut: use &quot;The Claw&quot; position. Curl the fingers of your opposite hand into a &quot;claw&quot; and rest just the tips of your fingers on top of the ingredient you&#x27;re about to cut. Tuck your thumb in; your wrist should be parallel to the cutting board. As you slice, move your fingers back, still keeping this claw formation. If your knife slips as you cut, it will hit against your knuckles or fingernails, protecting you from a serious slice.<br /><br /><strong>Stabilize your cutting board.</strong> Last but not least, stabilize your cutting board by placing a rubber mat or a damp paper towel underneath. This will keep it from slipping as you cut, helping you work more quickly and safely.</p>
